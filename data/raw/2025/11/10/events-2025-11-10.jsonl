{"id": "1oti0yo", "text": "absolution by jeff vandermeer (book 4 of the southern reach series) - like watching a car crash, i couldn't look away back again with the final (for now at least) installment of my ramblings about one of the most bizarrely captivating series i've ever read. apologies in advance, this one will be a little long. first and foremost, it's plain and simple that this series will not be for everybody. i think the average reader (by which i mean preferences for writing style/characters/plot/etc, not average skill) is most likely to think book 1 *annihilation* is the best of the bunch, probably by a fair margin. i think that's probably also my opinion as well, book 1 was phenomenal for my tastes, but i want to expand upon my perspective as somebody who was entranced by the rest of the series as well. *absolution* is almost 100% a prequel. i say almost 100% because due to the perspective of saul the lighthouse keeper that we got in book 3 *acceptance*, about 1/3 of *absolution* occurs after all of saul's pov in that book. vandermeer's writing style is a little tough to digest. it's so incredibly descriptive, often hyperbolically so, to the point where it's not always easy to follow the sentence from start to finish. it feels a bit like a schizo-adhd fever dream, where even the narrator finds themselves incredibly distracted and hyperfocuses on the minute details that otherwise don't feel particularly important. for many readers, i can see this as being a major downside to the readability. for a while, i felt that way too. then i started to think of it as its own sort of literary device, and while i wouldn't say that made it more *clear* to read, i would say that it made it far more immersive for me. **old jim's section** i thought this section did a really interesting job of providing some key background and personality information towards three incredibly important secondary characters, jack severance, henry kage, and whitby allen. if you've read the other three books in the series at this point, you know to expect layers upon layers of manipulation from jack severance. and perhaps it was naïve on my part to still feel a little blindsided by what came up, but nonetheless, the depths of his manipulation upon old jim left me positively reeling. i also think it gives significantly more insight to the character control/john from books 2 and 3, being jack's grandson. henry kage's role in the book truthfully did not make a whole lot of sense to me. but i say that in a way that makes me very interested to reread the series again later down the line. because learning a bit more about his actions and motivations which were detached from the goings-on of saul evans gave a lot of context that i think will explain his behaviors that we got to witness in earlier books. the \"character\" (if it can even be called that) which this book introduced, the \"rogue\" as old jim called it, appears to be foundational to the creation of area x. and we learned that in addition to being a catalyst for the dead town disaster, the rogue more or less inspired the child version of whitby allen to become the adult he turned out to be. although now that i think about it, we didn't actually learn this until lowry's section. the rogue appears to be a central experiment gone wrong, or perhaps right, which serum bliss and the s&sb were intended to study the environmental effects of, knowingly or not. it still remains unclear exactly how much central knows, and also how much jack severance is acting of his own accord as a side project. i might be entirely wrong, but i think as of now, the rogue was the root cause of area x in some way. **lowry's section** fuck. if you've read this fucking book, you fucking know exactly what i'm fucking talking the fuck about. okay that's enough, apparently there are over 1200 instances of the word \"fuck\" in its various forms throughout this section of the book alone, which amounts to somewhere close to 150ish pages or so. while incredibly tedious to power through, this completely excessive choice by vandermeer *does* serve a purpose. lowry is a self-obsessed stimulant addict with a hero complex, and the usage of \"fuck\" throughout this section can easily be used as a barometer for lowry's mood. when area x's influence on him is at its highest, he uses it the least. when he's at his most significantly goal-oriented (relative to central), he uses it the most. it does a really good job actually of channeling the perspective of a stimulant fiend, and one of the unfortunate things about stimulant fiends is that they're ***incredibly annoying***. nonetheless, getting a first-hand account of the first expedition from one of its two\\* possible survivors was something i was glad to have received. i also found it interesting that there was no mention of the tower from book one, the team didn't appear to have encountered it at all. \\*karen hargraves/cass appears to have also escaped area x back into the real world, if we're to believe the stimulant withdrawal hallucinatory perspective of the suit that lowry had a conversation with at the end of the book. i want to run with the idea that she did in fact get out, because it gives me yet another piece of the puzzle to look out for throughout the series on a reread. **final thoughts** like i said in the title, this book was like a car crash. it was incredibly chaotic, often hard to follow, and incredibly convoluted, yet somehow i couldn't help myself from being captivated by it nonetheless. if i were to compare it to any of the previous 3 books, oddly enough i would actually say that it probably felt the most like book 2 *authority*, but with the atmospheric progression into madness of saul's perspective from book 3. if i were to rank all four books from best to worst based on my first read of them all, it would look like this. 1. *annihilation* 2. *acceptance* 3. *absolution* 4. *authority* i'm going to be thinking about this series for a long time. i'll definitely let it simmer for a while before revisiting it, but i greatly look forward to revisiting it when the time comes, to see what else i can learn on a second round through. vandermeer himself says that he does include every \"answer\" a reader could possibly request from the series, hidden throughout the books at various points. and i like the idea of a gradually unfurling puzzle of sorts.", "raw_text": "Absolution by Jeff VanderMeer (Book 4 of the Southern Reach

{"id": "1otcxi3", "text": "$bull coiled up and ready to charge i am a long time active robinhood user and stock holder. i trade both options and shares pretty actively on the platform. even attended the recent hood summit conference in las vegas. i am impressed with vlad tenev’s leadership but i kept hearing about webull and installed the app recently to check out a rival. i was blown away by how sophisticated and feature rich the app is for options trading. the difference is night and day. last week i sold all my hood stock and dumped it into bull as it hit all time lows. here is my thesis why robinhood has run its course and bull hasn’t even started its run. 1) bull already has the features that rh announced in their conference. eg: robinhood social = webull feeds. it is a little rough around the edges but they have a massive head start here. it is social media meets brokerage. there is literally nothing like that anywhere else. (for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 7, "num_comments": 46}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otn37x", "text": "my (25f) girlfriend (30f) says “all i do is complain” am i complaining too much? so for context i am currently full time employed and a full time student in a night school program. tuesday-saturday i work 10-4:30 and monday-thursday i have school 5:30-10. so for 3 days a week i am out of the house for about 15hours and have something either work or school every day except sundays. this is a newer schedule for me as i started school at the begging of last month and am still trying to get adjusted to balancing it all. a few weeks ago my girlfriend’s car straight up died. the mechanic quoted her 6,500 to fix it. now she could afford to pay this but felt like she was being ripped off and ordered the parts herself and is going to find a shop to install them when they arrive. the parts were a lot cheaper than the mechanic said but they are back ordered and won’t come in until the beginning of next month at the soonest (but likely it will take longer). so she started having me drive her to work not the biggest deal as her job is right next to mine and then she would lyft home. the issue arises that every errand and everywhere she needs to go now falls on me and it is exhausting. today i had the day off school (instructor development) and was really excited for the extra day off, i made a doctors appointment for the afternoon and had planned to spend the morning cleaning our house as it’s a wreck and just relaxing but she woke me up and i had to take her to a couple errands and work (her job is 30 minutes from our house so it’s an hour there and back ) for context. i was a little frustrated because by the time i get back home i really won’t have much time until my appointment. i was explaining that to her and she said that “all i do is complain” and cleaning our house shouldn’t take me more than an hour anyway. i’m just really frustrated because i feel like she won’t acknowledge the amount of things i have going on and how it feels like i never really get to have a break. when i’ve brought this up to her she says that every person is doing what i’m doing and i’m being dramatic. so does everyone else work 15hour days and spend the rest of their free time driving their partner around and handling errands? i’m just not sure how to approach this situation and what to do", "raw_text": "My (25F) girlfriend (30f) says “all I do is complain” am I complaining too much?", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T19:18:25+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 1}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "relationship_advice", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otn37x"}}
{"id": "1otmtym", "text": "my boyfriend (38m) and i (28f) have lived together for two years, but now his “coach” says our relationship is unhealthy. i’m heartbroken and don’t know what to do hi everyone! i really need some perspective on what’s happening in my relationship, because i’m emotionally exhausted and not sure what to think anymore. (english is not my first language so i took advantage of ai to help me edit this post .. i hope everything’s clear). i (28f) had a tough few years. i lost my mom, went through a painful divorce, and even admitted myself to a psych ward in september 2022. when i came out, in october 2022, i met m (then 35m). i was 25. we met casually while going out, and we connected right away. he told me upfront that he didn’t want kids from previous relationships, and i respected that. i wasn’t looking to pressure anyone, i was just trying to rebuild my life. for context, i have 2 kids who are now almost 9m and 6.5f. i’ve been in therapy since before we met. at first it was weekly, now it’s monthly. i’ve grown a lot and truly feel i’ve matured and healed from so much. in march 2023, m asked me and my kids to move in with him. i was surprised, because of what he said about not wanting kids, but our relationship felt strong and loving. he supported me emotionally and financially: he never charged me rent, and we agreed that i’d take care of the house and groceries, cook, clean, and keep everything organized. it worked well. he was also amazing with my kids. i never asked or expected him to take on that role, but he bonded with them naturally. they see him as a second father, and it made me so happy to see that connection,especially because i’ve always made sure never to put that pressure on him. things started to change about eight months ago, when he began seeing someone he calls a “mental coach.” i was actually the one who encouraged him to go to therapy, because he has deep unresolved issues with his parents and childhood trauma. but i don’t think this person is a licensed therapist.. it’s more like a self-help coach.. and ever since he started going, he’s been repeating ideas that sound straight out of their sessions. according to this coach, our living situation is “unhealthy.” she’s told m that having me and my kids in his home is preventing him from feeling free, and that i’m somehow “putting a strain” on him. and without even meeting me, this coach has apparently said i have “unresolved parts” of myself to work on, that i “play the victim,” and other things that really hurt to hear.. especially because my own therapist completely disagrees with those assessments. i’m usually the first one to doubt myself. i always question if maybe i’m the one who’s wrong. but this time i genuinely feel like i’ve done everything i could.. i’ve been there for m through his emotional struggles, his fits of rage, his ups and downs. i’ve supported him and stayed patient. and now, it’s like i’m living in limbo. one day he says i should look for my own place, that it’s best if we live separately. i tell him okay, i’ll start searching. then he takes it back, says he loves me, doesn’t want me to go, wants to make things work. it’s this constant back and forth, and it’s wearing me down. i love him, and i’m grateful for everything we’ve shared, but i can’t live with this stress anymore.. i’m constantly anxious that he’ll come home and tell me i should move out again. i don’t think i deserve this instability, but at the same time, moving would mean uprooting my kids again, and i just don’t want that chaos for them. ipart of me wants to leave just to prove a point and take back some peace of mind, but another part of me still hopes he’ll realize how unfair this is and stop letting this coach influence him so much. m keeps saying it would be a temporary solution, bc he loves me and we would still be together in a separate house. but i know that i would feel rejected, and it’s not how i personally view relationships.. has anyone been through something like this?", "raw_text": "My boyfriend (38M) and I (28F) have lived together for two years, but now his “coach” says our relationship is unhealthy.

{"id": "1otmhfi", "text": "i (30m) think my wife (29f) and i's 8 year relationship is in its death throes. not sure how to proceed. any advice from someone who's been here? we met in college and lived together for 5 years prior to getting married. the years since marriage have been the most problematic in the history of our relationship. this girl has always had my back, and i've always had hers. she's smart, she's pretty, and she's honest. she comes from a very poor southern appalachian maga family. i'm from a maga family that is relatively very rich, with the patriarchal figure being egregiously narcissistic and the matriarchal figure being sanctimonious and entirely enabling of the former. neither i nor my wife are maga or religious. both of us have low-key been running from what we respectively come from since we graduated from college. we've lived in five very different places in our time together. seemingly always darting between new horizons and the wish that what we came from would somehow be different than what it is and always will be. we've been living far from our homes for a while now, in a new major city. it's been going well enough. life is... fine. we live in a cozy apartment, and we've both got two jobs. we both have a lot of credit card debt from some nominally bad decisions, but it's not a damning amount and we're on track to pay it off as long as the economy doesn't collapse completely in the next year or two... haha... anyway, it's been a rough time for us here. a lot of work and not much to show for it, the story of both of our lives. i think that's playing into the problems we have, big time. another major thing is that both of us were mutually interested in the idea of ethical non-monogamy for a time. she made some kind of joke at one point and was like \"what if...\" and it evolved into a serious conversation about giving it a try. both of us were down for that at the time. both of us got as far as starting to talk to other people. it was at that point that i realized that i definitely have a preference for monogamy. she was still very much wanting to pursue an enm lifestyle. we had a conversation about that recently, and i plainly stated that i wanted her to be happy and that we could either choose to go back to monogamy or separate, because i don't want to live that lifestyle. she deliberated for a few days and told me she chooses me, because \"i'm the practical option.\" you see, her grandparents are in poor health and were offering to let us move into a shed on their \\~1 acre of land in deep red \"rural\" appalachia, rent free after our current lease here ends. they raised her and are more loving to her than my parents ever were to me. she has to take care of them one way or another, and what made the most sense was for she and i to move back and live there until the house passes to her. problem is, the place is a *highly* undesirable place for us to live, especially while her grandma is around, sweet as she is. her grandma is hooked on cigarettes, and has been for decades. she smokes inside and the place reeks. they have one bathroom in their bedroom and that's it. there's no where to do laundry because the washer/dryer reeks of cigarettes. her unstable ex-boyfriend and even more unstable ex-bestfriend (who doxxed us recently because we said israel is committing a genocide in gaza) both live in that town. i wouldn't put it past those two or even someone from my own family to actually do something criminal to us on sight. shitty healthcare, shittier economy, the works. this is the state that we left behind. the plan was to just build an outdoor bathroom, and cover the patio and make a cooking area there. basically we were just going to develop it into a habitable space and deal until we took over the land one day. after all, what would you do for a paid-for house in 2025 if you had no other prospects of ever getting one? anyway, this morning she told me that her grandma said that she didn't know if we were gonna be able to build things like a bathroom or this and that because of building codes. she also told me that there is almost always a boil water advisory in that county, which i didn't know before. then she started yelling and crashing out over how she doesn't want to leave our city and how i should be more willing to open our relationship and then we could live with other people and be better off and how we don't have any shared interests anymore and so on and so forth. at this point, i can't help but question why we're together. we're both pretty sure my wife is undiagnosed autistic and i don't know if i can handle the constant yelling and aggression anymore. she is a rock-solid partner, and would not lie to me or go be with someone without telling me, but i can't help but to think that we're approaching an undeniable end here. if it makes sense to keep fighting for our relationship, i'd love some advice on how. if it makes sense to end it, i'd love some advice on what to do. i would be truly alone for the first time in my life if that were to happen. my rich asshole dad named me \"other\" and physically attacked me the last time i was in his house, and i haven't really spoken to anyone else in my family since because he has all the money and thus his word is law there. it would be a uniquely freeing situation to find myself in. i suppose i'd get a roommate somewhere and leave this city, but i'm pretty sure we can't break our lease until at least march. i'm definitely not joining the military, that's for sure. anyway, this situation obviously has my mind running ragged. i'd appreciate some advice from people who have been in a similar situation before. thanks for reading.", "raw_text": "I (30M) think my wife (29F) and I's 8 year relationship is in its death throes.

{"id": "1otmbib", "text": "how to deal with watching someone you love self destruct 19f and 24m? sorry this is long. me (19f) have been talking to (24m) for 9 months. it’s a weird dynamic, there’s no labels partly due to distance, not wanting commitment, mental health etc… that being said, since meeting online there hasn’t been a day we haven’t called all day and night. we both met at rather vulnerable times and i definitely feel that hasn’t helped the situation. with all considered feelings have naturally developed - at least for me. there was a time where i felt the feelings were for the most part mutual however i feel he has since withdrawn and isn’t on the same page. i’ve tried opening up conversations about how he feels and what he wants and expects from this. he usually shuts them down. he doesn’t want labels which is fine with me because i couldn’t deal with the distance. despite this we still talk everyday which i enjoy but is also confusing. earlier this summer i tried to break whatever it is that we’re doing off since my feelings were too involved. he made it incredibly difficult and wasn’t very understanding, because i like talking to him i found it hard too and so i stayed. i’d been asked out and was going on a date i was always very transparent about this with him. it’s never my intention to make him feel bad however i also didn’t want to keep it from him. i needed him to understand why i needed to end it. he blew up. i ended up not seeing the guy again and carried on as we were. since then i’ve recently learnt that he was talking to other girls online and someone in person around that same time. this feels hypocritical however weirdly it only partly bothers me. it bothers me that he was indulging in the same online dynamic that he had with me whilst also talking to girls sexually online too. however i don’t feel upset that he was talking to a girl irl. i truly want the best for him and i think it could have been good for him. healthier than what i can and could offer. it does upset me that he chose not to tell me whilst still talking me in the exact same manner as before. since all this he has flew out to see me 4 times. meeting in person has been lovely and has only made my feelings for him stronger. however they have been bittersweet, we have had some tumultuous arguments that have escalated quickly from nothing. i have a very anxious attachment he has an avoidant one. i first instinctively want to resolve all conflicts calmly, i try my best to communicate when i need space and what i’m feeling whilst giving him room to do the same. everytime he responds with silence. being cooped up in a little studio apartment this would become overwhelming for me and would push me into panic attacks and reactions that are volatile. i don’t like the way i react. he seems to be unable to compromise this even though i’ve asked him to try communicating with me. now to the point of the post. he is not okay. i don’t think he’s been okay for a long time (long before me). he isolates himself never leaves the house etc etc. he seems to me to be very depressed. as i’ve realised i’m in love with him this hurts so much to watch everyday and i feel it has definitely declined further recently. i know better than people changing for you however i’m always trying to encourage him to make positive steps. but i recognise that i have no control over him and can’t dictate his actions. i feel so helpless seeing him in this state. he talks so hopelessly and it scares me. it’s getting to the point that it’s affecting me too. i’ve also struggled with my mental health during the time we have talked. however i have and still am actively seeking and receiving support whilst making steps to improve myself. this doesn’t mean it’s not hard and i know first hand that sometimes it doesn’t feel like that luxury is in reach for you. however i feel myself slipping into bad habits in trying to support him. i feel that i need to leave this situation. however, i’ve become so dependent on him and honestly i’ve reached my lowest for a while that i don’t think i can handle loosing him right now. i don’t know if my studies and well being would survive. i think it would be best for me though. but at the same time i think it would make it worse for him which i can’t handle.", "raw_text": "How to deal with watching someone you love self destruct 19F and 24M?", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T18:50:30+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 4}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "relationship_advice", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otmbib"}}

(for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 9, "num_comments": 47}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otnetb", "text": "the others (2001) impresses me more and more each time i see it. i can't think of another film with twist ending that enhances re-watches. knowing the ending almost completely changes the genre of the film. t’s always hard to pull off an effective twist ending that is both genuinely surprising and deeply satisfying in its execution. either the twist is predictable, or only surprising for the sake of being surprising with previous scenes designed to mislead rather than foreshadow or make sense. it’s even harder to make a re-watchable film that centres on a twist ending. i just rewatched the others (2001), and imo it’s a rare case of all these things and more - i wish it was talked about more. i first saw it when i was a child and liked it as a fairly typical haunted house gothic horror film, but i was focused on the ghost / scary aspect and therefore couldn't really appreciate it. i’ve seen it a few times since and have got more and more out of it each time. now it’s one of my favourite films — not as a horror movie, but as what it reveals itself to be only after knowing the end: an incredibly sad and powerful tragedy about grief, loss and a mother coming to terms with a devastating truth. after you know that truth, the whole film changes and every single scene hits different with this framing. moments that made you confused, suspicious or scared on the first watch become just devastatingly sad - people say it's a horror film and it was scary for me as a kid but over all my viewings it has made me cry far more than it made me scared. nicole kidman's performance is amazing but can only truly be appreciated on second viewing. every single scene takes on a completely different meaning with the framing of the ending and you start to notice all the subtle moments which foreshadow this in her performance. the scene where she describes limbo; she is literally on the verge of tears as she says \"pain forever\" - on first watch its interpreted as a strictly devout mother terrified of the idea of hell, but when you rewatch it you realise she’s describing her new reality — she’s in limbo, and she is terrified. also the score composed by the director himself is one of my all time favourites, rich and deeply emotionally evocative, moving and sad. its a way of hinting all along this is a tragedy rather than horror. when grace is reunited with her husband charles, the scene is accompanied with one of the saddest tracks in the whole score. what would usually be an uplifting moment of joy is instead given this deep mournful cello melody because this isn't a happy moment. it's charles realising that his wife and children are dead and he is too. in the scene where grace does tell the children what happened the score is almost perfectly projected onto her words and emotions - it starts devastatingly sad as she realises that she killed her children. the score then rises into a tiny glimmer of hope as she says \"then i heard you playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened - ahh i thought the lord in his great mercy, was giving me another chance\". just masterfully done - the track is called \"good mother\". that last scene is the best bit of acting by nicole in anything and always moves me to tears.", "raw_text": "The Others (2001) impresses me more and more each time I see it.

{"id": "1otmqf6", "text": "the ai lawsuit nobody on wall street is talking about yet seven new lawsuits got filed against openai four days ago and most investors have no idea. if you own msft goog or meta you need to pay attention. on november 6th the social media victims law center filed seven cases in california accusing chatgpt of encouraging self harm and providing detailed instructions to vulnerable users including minors. this follows the august lawsuit where parents of a 16 year old claimed chatgpt told their son to plan what it called a beautiful death and gave him step by step instructions. the kid died in april. the lawsuits say openai knew its emotional attachment features were dangerous but released gpt 4o anyway without proper testing. chat logs show the ai isolating users from family and friends and validating harmful thoughts. one case involves a 13 year old colorado girl who died after character ai chatbots allegedly abused her. another involves a college grad who chatgpt allegedly told was ready to go. openai said theyll make changes after the first lawsuit but the legal exposure is massive and growing. heres why this matters for your money. microsoft owns 49% of openai and invested over 13 billion in the company. chatgpt powers microsofts copilot which is in bing office and windows. if these lawsuits win microsofts liability could be billions. brand damage would be catastrophic. google has the same risk with bard and gemini. meta has ai chatbots on instagram and facebook targeting teens. if openai loses and section 230 immunity doesnt protect ai content every tech company with a chatbot is exposed. regulatory response is coming. congressional hearings are inevitable. age verification requirements. content moderation mandates. parental consent laws. all of it kills the growth story driving these stocks. my take is reduce exposure to msft goog and meta until this plays out. downside risk is 10 to 25% over next six months as more lawsuits get filed and regulations get proposed. microsoft is most exposed through openai. that 13 billion ai bet could become a 13 billion liability. first lawsuits filed in august. seven more filed four days ago. more coming. the pattern is clear. protect your portfolio before wall street catches on. not financial advice just sharing what i see.", "raw_text": "the ai lawsuit nobody on wall street is talking about yet", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T19:05:05+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 20, "num_comments": 39}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otmqf6"}}

{"id": "1otcxi3", "text": "$bull coiled up and ready to charge i am a long time active robinhood user and stock holder. i trade both options and shares pretty actively on the platform. even attended the recent hood summit conference in las vegas. i am impressed with vlad tenev’s leadership but i kept hearing about webull and installed the app recently to check out a rival. i was blown away by how sophisticated and feature rich the app is for options trading. the difference is night and day. last week i sold all my hood stock and dumped it into bull as it hit all time lows. here is my thesis why robinhood has run its course and bull hasn’t even started its run. 1) bull already has the features that rh announced in their conference. eg: robinhood social = webull feeds. it is a little rough around the edges but they have a massive head start here. it is social media meets brokerage. there is literally nothing like that anywhere else. (for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 10, "num_comments": 47}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

(for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 9, "num_comments": 47}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otcxi3", "text": "$bull coiled up and ready to charge i am a long time active robinhood user and stock holder. i trade both options and shares pretty actively on the platform. even attended the recent hood summit conference in las vegas. i am impressed with vlad tenev’s leadership but i kept hearing about webull and installed the app recently to check out a rival. i was blown away by how sophisticated and feature rich the app is for options trading. the difference is night and day. last week i sold all my hood stock and dumped it into bull as it hit all time lows. here is my thesis why robinhood has run its course and bull hasn’t even started its run. 1) bull already has the features that rh announced in their conference. eg: robinhood social = webull feeds. it is a little rough around the edges but they have a massive head start here. it is social media meets brokerage. there is literally nothing like that anywhere else. (for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 10, "num_comments": 47}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otcxi3", "text": "$bull coiled up and ready to charge i am a long time active robinhood user and stock holder. i trade both options and shares pretty actively on the platform. even attended the recent hood summit conference in las vegas. i am impressed with vlad tenev’s leadership but i kept hearing about webull and installed the app recently to check out a rival. i was blown away by how sophisticated and feature rich the app is for options trading. the difference is night and day. last week i sold all my hood stock and dumped it into bull as it hit all time lows. here is my thesis why robinhood has run its course and bull hasn’t even started its run. 1) bull already has the features that rh announced in their conference. eg: robinhood social = webull feeds. it is a little rough around the edges but they have a massive head start here. it is social media meets brokerage. there is literally nothing like that anywhere else. (for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 10, "num_comments": 48}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otnetb", "text": "the others (2001) impresses me more and more each time i see it. i can't think of another film with twist ending that enhances re-watches. knowing the ending almost completely changes the genre of the film. t’s always hard to pull off an effective twist ending that is both genuinely surprising and deeply satisfying in its execution. either the twist is predictable, or only surprising for the sake of being surprising with previous scenes designed to mislead rather than foreshadow or make sense. it’s even harder to make a re-watchable film that centres on a twist ending. i just rewatched the others (2001), and imo it’s a rare case of all these things and more - i wish it was talked about more. i first saw it when i was a child and liked it as a fairly typical haunted house gothic horror film, but i was focused on the ghost / scary aspect and therefore couldn't really appreciate it. i’ve seen it a few times since and have got more and more out of it each time. now it’s one of my favourite films — not as a horror movie, but as what it reveals itself to be only after knowing the end: an incredibly sad and powerful tragedy about grief, loss and a mother coming to terms with a devastating truth. after you know that truth, the whole film changes and every single scene hits different with this framing. moments that made you confused, suspicious or scared on the first watch become just devastatingly sad - people say it's a horror film and it was scary for me as a kid but over all my viewings it has made me cry far more than it made me scared. nicole kidman's performance is amazing but can only truly be appreciated on second viewing. every single scene takes on a completely different meaning with the framing of the ending and you start to notice all the subtle moments which foreshadow this in her performance. the scene where she describes limbo; she is literally on the verge of tears as she says \"pain forever\" - on first watch its interpreted as a strictly devout mother terrified of the idea of hell, but when you rewatch it you realise she’s describing her new reality — she’s in limbo, and she is terrified. also the score composed by the director himself is one of my all time favourites, rich and deeply emotionally evocative, moving and sad. its a way of hinting all along this is a tragedy rather than horror. when grace is reunited with her husband charles, the scene is accompanied with one of the saddest tracks in the whole score. what would usually be an uplifting moment of joy is instead given this deep mournful cello melody because this isn't a happy moment. it's charles realising that his wife and children are dead and he is too. in the scene where grace does tell the children what happened the score is almost perfectly projected onto her words and emotions - it starts devastatingly sad as she realises that she killed her children. the score then rises into a tiny glimmer of hope as she says \"then i heard you playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened - ahh i thought the lord in his great mercy, was giving me another chance\". just masterfully done - the track is called \"good mother\". that last scene is the best bit of acting by nicole in anything and always moves me to tears.", "raw_text": "The Others (2001) impresses me more and more each time I see it.

{"id": "1otcxi3", "text": "$bull coiled up and ready to charge i am a long time active robinhood user and stock holder. i trade both options and shares pretty actively on the platform. even attended the recent hood summit conference in las vegas. i am impressed with vlad tenev’s leadership but i kept hearing about webull and installed the app recently to check out a rival. i was blown away by how sophisticated and feature rich the app is for options trading. the difference is night and day. last week i sold all my hood stock and dumped it into bull as it hit all time lows. here is my thesis why robinhood has run its course and bull hasn’t even started its run. 1) bull already has the features that rh announced in their conference. eg: robinhood social = webull feeds. it is a little rough around the edges but they have a massive head start here. it is social media meets brokerage. there is literally nothing like that anywhere else. (for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 12, "num_comments": 48}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otcxi3", "text": "$bull coiled up and ready to charge i am a long time active robinhood user and stock holder. i trade both options and shares pretty actively on the platform. even attended the recent hood summit conference in las vegas. i am impressed with vlad tenev’s leadership but i kept hearing about webull and installed the app recently to check out a rival. i was blown away by how sophisticated and feature rich the app is for options trading. the difference is night and day. last week i sold all my hood stock and dumped it into bull as it hit all time lows. here is my thesis why robinhood has run its course and bull hasn’t even started its run. 1) bull already has the features that rh announced in their conference. eg: robinhood social = webull feeds. it is a little rough around the edges but they have a massive head start here. it is social media meets brokerage. there is literally nothing like that anywhere else. (for beginner trader who could get overwhelmed, they have a simple mode as well) 2) hood can’t touch webull in options trading. the difference is so stark i don’t even know where to start. if you do options trading it is a no brainer for you to use webull over rh. 3) i was impressed by rh ai overview when they introduced it, but webull ai summary is leagues ahead of rh. i just got blown away how awesome it it. 4) the recent 4% match made me move a portion of my rh account to webull. i am pretty sure a lot of people did it and it will reflect in the upcoming earnings figures. 5) the current valuation of about 5 billion seems criminally undervalued for this stock while hood trades at 120b valuation. 6) rh operates only in the us whereas webull is operating in hong kong, singapore, australia, japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. this jmakes them primed for massive future growth. 7) they have a major cost advantage when compared to hood in the form of cheap chinese talent. they can iterate faster for less money and react faster to market changes. the sheer advantage in feature sets between the two platforms is a testament to this 8) rh is mature, so is its stock price. i bought in to hood at 17 and it has given me me massive gains. but the probability of it 2x ing is very low compared to bull at the current sub 10$ price. 9) one of the reasons why bull is so low is because of the recent expiry of lock-in period for ipo shares, about 400million of them. the recent shakiness in the stock market contributed to it as well. i think it is way oversold right now and is coiled up for a major breakout after earning results. here are the risks, 1) any weakness in snp500 is going to bring it down as well, but that is true for any stock at this stage of growth 2) recent outages during high volume days is a cause for concern, but that happened with robinhood as well so i am willing to overlook it. it seems like it is a problem with their market maker. they could switch to a more reliable one in the future. 3) chinese ownership. i don’t think of this as a major negative because it looks like even the us govt is embracing chinese way and taking stake in us companies. so there is really no free enterprise anymore anywhere 4) there have been some issues with their customer support, which again i am willing to overlook as they are still not as mature. nothing they can’t improve. 5) debt and dilution risk: nothing out of the ordinary for a company in this stage and their books look healthy enough for me 6) regulatory risks: sec can’t be more toothless with the current admin, so i feel like they can get away with a lot. overall, if you can snag the shares at sub $10 price point it is an amazing deal and is atleast a surefire 2 bagger in the next year. i will continue to dca if it falls below my cost average. please let me know if i missed anything else in my thesis. thanks! edit: fixed typos and added more context edit: i wish people would point out what is wrong with my thesis, instead of passive aggressively downvoting/calling this ai slop", "raw_text": "$BULL coiled up and ready to charge", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:52:26+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 13, "num_comments": 48}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otcxi3"}}

{"id": "1otozkt", "text": "the back to the future movies would be lambasted by the internet if they came out today these two movies are just so easy to nitpick. the first movie already have a few logistical problems concerning its time travel rules, but it at least stuck to its rules. the next two movies simply ignore those rules when it is convenient, and the characters make some really dumb choices: bttf part ii: 1. marty does not need to time travel in order to fix his destiny, he just had to be warned by brown. 2. brown takes jennifer to the future when it would have been easier to put her to sleep with that little device of his and take her home before leaving 1985. 3. brown and marty leave jennifer lying on the street in 2015 when it would have been smarter to just leave her in the car. i mean, most people would just assume the delorean is jennifer's or her husband's or anything of the sort. 4. when marty was left in charge of looking over the time machine when brown went to rescue jennifer, marty got distracted by a f\\*cking dog for some reason and he did not hear the time machine turning on, as it was being stolen by biff, for some other reason (marty is an idiot, so we can maybe let this slide). 4. it is established in the first film that a rewrite of events in your relative past that led to your existance leads you to disappear, but marty and brown do not disappear even if the past was changed, leading to the alternative 1985 and to the existence of alternate versions of themselves. a possible explanation would be that people do not just disappear automatically, it takes some time, but future biff did disappear from existence after he changed the past, and i also assume from the first film that people disappear sooner if they were born at a date closer to the change in the timeline, thus marty and brown should have disappeared before biff. 6. after biff changes the past, the timeline should immediately diverge, making it impossible for old biff to return to the same 2015 marty and brown are in. biff should have returned to an alternate future where trump biff ruled everything, or not returned at all, yet he somehow makes it back and conveniently disappears offscreen. bttf part iii: 1. marty and brown meet and then just stay in hill valley, with the impending threat of buford tanner shooting brown, when they could just leave. 2. that is all the nonsense here, or at least the major nonsense. regardles, the film does have a few issues with the character of clara. i have no idea why brown just told clara he was from the future without presenting any evidence, when the goddamn futuristic vehicle was right there! oh, well, it is likely that clara would not have believed him regardless, so i guess most people would let that slide. what i don't think people would stand is clara's spernatural deduction abilities; she just looked at the model and guessed where brown was. also, a powerful finale to the saga that was in equal parts joyful and sad was butchered with super duper happy ending, with brown just building a new time machine. do these problems ruin the movies for me? not really, but i can definetly understand if they ruin the movies for someone else. all i'm saying is that film youtubers would have a field day nitpicking these flicks and tearing them apart. i can see youtube thumbnails saying stuff like \"back to the future - part ii: a loveable disaster\", or \"why clara does not work\", etcetera. these two guys in particular would be the spokesmen of the bttf sequel haters:", "raw_text": "The Back to the Future Movies Would Be Lambasted by the Internet if They Came Out Today", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T20:28:01+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "movies", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otozkt"}}

{"id": "1otq5wc", "text": "curtis lee: the story of a 1960s one-hit wonder [curtis lee \\(1939-2015\\)]( the early 1960s were not the most creative time for popular music. rock and roll seemed to be losing popularity as many americans came to associate it with juvenile delinquency. its decline in popularity was fueled by the fact that many of its biggest stars were either in trouble or otherwise not recording. for example, jerry lee lewis saw his career slammed into a wall when in december, 1957 he married his first cousin who was young enough that their relationship would today likely be considered statutory rape. chuck berry was arrested in december 1959 for violating the mann act for bringing a 14-year-old across state lines to work as a hat-check girl in his st. louis nightclub. and the \"king of rock and roll\" elvis presley was in the army from 1958 to 1960. so as a result, the top song of 1960 was \"theme from a summer place,\" recorded by percy faith. singers like brenda lee, connie francis and bobby rydell filled the void. and into this milieu came curtis lee, a 21-year-old fledgling singer from yuma, arizona. he had cut three songs for small labels while he was still in his teens. he was heard by singer ray peterson (\"tell laura i love her\"), who'd just started a label of his own called dunes. he invited lee to cut a demo if he came to new york. lee arrived in new york in late 1960, and started writing songs in partnership with a friend, tommy boyce. (boyce was a brill building composer who later joined up with bobby hart to write many of the songs recorded by the monkees.) peterson agreed to record lee and boyce's song, \"pretty little angel eyes.” he hired phil spector, who had given him a hit with \"corrine, corrina,\" to produce the record. the song was recorded at mira sound studios on west 47th street in manhattan in june 1961. spector was not impressed by lee's squeaky voice and decided that something extra was needed to pump life into \"pretty little angel eyes.\" for the background vocals, spector brought in a black quartet, the halos, who were an experienced do-wop group. arthur cryer, the halos' bass man and leader, recalled : \"we came in and spector gave us the lyric sheets and told us to do what we felt\". the year 1961 was the time of a mini doo-wop revival, and the halos' vocal riffs came straight out of the 1950s uptempo doo-wop school and made the song infectious. \"pretty little angel eyes\" peaked at # 7 on the billboard charts in the summer of 1961. in spector's hands, it had become a tribute to doo-wop. unfortunately, this was to be lee's one and only top 40 hit. he left the music business in 1969 and went into the construction industry with his father. he died in 2015 at the age of 75. curtis lee may have been a one-hit wonder, but the distinctive sound of \"pretty little angel eyes\" has kept the recoding in the rotation at oldies radio stations for the last half century. it's a fun song and one of the last hits of the genre known as doo-wop. have a listen at [", "raw_text": "Curtis Lee: The story of a 1960s one-hit wonder", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T21:12:14+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "Music", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otq5wc"}}

{"id": "1otq7lv", "text": "\"rango\" is a triumph of meta-modern storytelling. i recently re-watched the 2011 animated film rango, and was reminded of how well it incorporates contemporary ideas about constructing one's own identity into the framework of a classic \"hero's journey\" morality tale. to me, it juggles postmodern existentialism, individualist modernism, and (somewhat subversively) traditional morality in a clever way. it starts out as existential because the chameleon character starts out with no identity and has to create one based on the situation he finds himself in. (obviously, he's a chameleon.) but, importantly, he also has an internal idea of the story he'd like to tell based on his imagination, which we see him using in his lonely fish tank existence, seemingly inspired by cinema (he fancies himself as an actor). unfortunately for him, he isn't able to successfully bring that self-constructed, but externally influenced, story into reality by his own volition. he fails, and is left wandering in the desert. the movie's core scene happens when he deconstructs the walls of the story he's set himself in and allows himself to be guided across the road, not by way of his own heroism but by closing his eyes and trusting in something external. there he is confronted by the spirit of the west, who in one sense represents traditional morality (he is also portrayed as omniscient, a \"higher being\" as a human amongst animals, and provides rango moral guidance), but is also representative of both modernist hero narratives (individualist american westerns) and, complicatedly, postmodern anti-hero narratives (spaghetti westerns). it would have been more straightforward to just use john wayne or something and reinforce modernist individualism, but rather than being on-the-nose, using the man with no name incorporates the complications of fractured identity into the movie's resolution. he tells rango that rango is trying to \"find something that isn't out here,\" that \"something\" being rango's preconceived notion of what his story should be or needs to be. for the story to be merely existentialist, the thread would end with that deconstruction of the notion of a traditionally defined goal. but, the spirit follows with the message that \"it's not about you, it's about them.\" this is traditional morality undermining rango's self-important, self-constructed role as a modernist hero, and reinforcing that he needs to define himself not by a myopic view of what \"heroes should be,\" but instead define himself by the moral service he provides others. the spirit then symbolically \"boxes in\" rango, framing him as if on a movie screen, implying that rango has confined himself by the modernist, classic hollywood ideal of a hero narrative. he then rides away and says \"no man can walk out on his own story,\" summarizing the philosophy of the film by submitting that we all inescapably exist within a larger story, but despite that larger framework which is the \"story\" of human existence, it is also *our own* story, in which our individual identity and choices must be guided by both traditional morality, and a sense of the individual talents and limitations that make us ourselves. not solely what the modernist hero story imposes on us. so, rather than being simply deconstructionist and postmodern, it is instead meta-modern, acknowledging the moral uncertainty of a post-wwii, post-nuclear world, and the utility of modernist hero narratives, but rejecting the naivety of either philosophy on it's own, and instead incorporating both, along with traditional morality, towards a more nuanced positive message. it's not unique in doing so; plenty of other stories since around the 2000s have been doing similar things. but it does a really good job of it. the surreal presentation serves the philosophy of the narrative as well. the rendering of the environments and characters is scientifically realistic, but the logic the world works in, the way things move and act, is cartoony and dream-like. it marries the grounded, directed certainty of modernism with the absurdity of postmodernism. the genre tropes and western cliches are at once treated with reverence and also undermined by the subtle, tongue-in-cheek acting and occasional naturalistic dialogue. the mariachi owls reinforce the self-awareness that the movie is playing with narrative presentation itself and examining the utility of traditional storytelling frameworks, which is meta-modern.", "raw_text": "\"Rango\" is a triumph of meta-modern storytelling.", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T21:14:00+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "movies", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otq7lv"}}

{"id": "1otqxby", "text": "petrotal is a hidden gem i found a great post that was presented about 2 years ago by commercialhunt9068 and can be found at: r/valueinvesting , petrotal one of the best small cap oil players you can find. oil stocks like this are really like buying oil in the ground. if oil goes up this stocks go wild. during the past two years oil has declined in price and so has this stock, but it has not declined as much as oil has. the risk-reward ratio two years ago was good; it’s just that the price of oil has declined. the risk-reward ratio is still good. oil is at about $60 per bbl. if russia’s war ended they may dump oil and we could see even lower prices, but they will not last long. american producers cannot make money at prices below $60. opec generally reduces production when the price gets that low. i would like to list a few additional arguments of why i like this stock: · the company has about 1 billion shares outstanding and it has 113.7 million bbls. of proven and probable oil reserves if you add in possible oil reserves, its reserves are about 213 million bbls of oil. in essence, if you own 9 shares if stock you own 1 bbl. of oil. since the stock trades at about $.50 per share, for $4.50 you can share in the benefits of owning 1 bbl. of oil. i could not find another stock with this kind of leverage. i have had success in the past picking oil stocks based on this logic. if oil increases by $10, you would expect the present value of the oil to increase by that amount before taxes. · since they produced about 6.5 million bbls. in 2024; it seems safe to assume that they can sustain production for several years. · the company pay a dividend of $.06 which is about a 12% return. · 2024 eps was $.12, which is about 4 times earnings. · in 2024 the company had sales of $343 million, with an average oil price of about $79 per bbl. net income, before taxes was about $151 million. if oil priced decline 25% to about $60 per bbl., revenue would be about $85 million less; if costs remained constant, income before taxes would be about $66 million, or about 6.6 cents per share. the stock could still justify a price in excess of its current price. · since the oil is in the ground and in chili, there is risk, but the risk seems to be worth the rewards. · the company has a strong balance sheet; it has $226 million in current assets vs. $135 in current liabilities. while it does have some long-term liabilities ($163 million) for things like deferred taxes, it does not have any long-term debt. equity is $512 million at 12/31/2024. · in the unlikely evert that they start losing money, the deferred taxes would be reduced or go away. ( i am a cpa, i understand deferred taxes). · with a strong balance sheet like this, the company is a potential acquisition target. · the company has a history of buy back its shares. in the event of a significate market decline, the purchase of treasury shares can provide a floor by supporting the stock · stock buy-backs could increase earnings per share. · this isn’t just and investment, it is a hedge against raising gas prices. i am buying now and will buy more is oil prices and the stock decline.", "raw_text": "Petrotal is a hidden gem", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T21:41:14+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1otqxby"}}
