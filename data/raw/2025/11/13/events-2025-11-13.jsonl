{"id": "1ouj47e", "text": "searching for life's purpose (if the post is too long, just answer these questions: what do you think the purpose of life is, and do you have any advice for me? do we even have free will?) i am 23 year old a recent computer science graduate, and i am really unsure what to do in life. first of all, i am truly confused: what is the purpose of our life? is it doing great things? is it solving big problems for society that fundamentally change and help future generations? or is making ourselves happy the priority? initially, i thought the purpose of life was making money, making your parents proud, and buying whatever you want. inspired by tech founders like elon musk and mark zuckerberg, i worked incredibly hard. i used to work all day, had zero social life, no connection with family and friends, and tried to prove to the world what i was capable of so that no one would ever take me lightly. in the end, i became depressed. i don't hate what i did, but i felt like i was working hard without seeing it as part of a whole life. someone once said: dreams are just to dream; don't live in them. then, i started thinking differently. i changed my mind: nothing is more important than your physical and mental health. so, i decided to take it easy. i began to realize that nothing else truly mattered to me—neither how others saw me nor what others possessed. i was happy with little money. i then realized that life is just a matter of perspective. someone with a luxurious life may feel sad, while someone with almost nothing can be happier than them because he or she doesn't expect anything from life. it's like pain is there, but nobody suffers because it depends on the perspective: how you see something, what you expect, how your mind releases dopamine, and how you perceive your surroundings to be satisfied with your life. so, i concluded the purpose of life is to be happy. i considered living in a small village, perhaps in a good area, and becoming a local school teacher to live a simple and peaceful life (which i once thought was the way to a happy life). and yet... i then realized we only live once, and since i don't know what happens after death, i should avoid doing ordinary things like wasting time on social media or watching movies and series to live a fantasy life we can't afford. instead, i thought i should build something truly great in life that nobody has thought of before, like einstein in science, pablo picasso in art, or elon musk in business. (i really don't want to *be* any of them, but i admire them because i think one should be unique.) it's most shocking to realize that most people live life for others—driven by how people judge them, inspired by social media influencers, or just trying to fit into society, which is a common human desire. some people even live in illogical mental states, like following religious gurus and being illogical their whole life, yet they are truly happy because they believe whatever happens is for the good. most shockingly, many people never question the illogical aspects of their minds, living out fantasies, exhibiting personality traits they don't want, or living a life driven by stubbornness or an illogical mindset. they live just to show off, seeking external validation for how others see and perceive them. i genuinely love sciences. in school, physics and math were my favorite subjects. i wanted to go into a hardware-related field but landed in computer science, which i truly enjoyed learning. i also love reading and solving complex and hard problems. i tend to go too deep and critical into any problem, be it psychology, religion, business, philosophy, or life itself. sometimes, i feel like i am either overthinking or i am a perfectionist. i feel that whatever i do, i must do it fully, with passion and love, and truly enjoy it. i love history, space science,math, and exploring **nature** like an **explorer**, whether it's the sea, the jungle, or animals, among so many different fields. i am really unsure about my future: should i build a tech startup (failure or success doesn't matter, but just try it), or go for a master's in space science or robotics? then sometimes, i feel like there are so many things in life, and you can never do all of them. perhaps i should just go into a field where i have an edge due to my past 23 years, utilizing my love for math, physics, history, psychology, and business. but i want to start from zero if needed. i don't want to live someone else's life or be trapped in an illogical mindset, but most importantly, in today's capitalism, money matters the most. what really matters at the end of life? happiness, health, or connections? what is it? so, i have followings questions: what do you think the purpose of life is? do you have any advice for me? do we even have free will?", "raw_text": "Searching for Life's Purpose (If the post is too long, just answer these questions: What do you think the purpose of life is, and do you have any advice for me?

{"id": "1ovv53g", "text": "a major mountain i designed in minecraft inspired by denali mount noraker (named after foraker) stands as the current tallest mountain in my minecraft world sky pixel, rising 1024 blocks high. i designed it to capture the raw power and isolation i felt in the alaskan range near denali — an area where i filmed scenes for my indie film harlow. denali, to me, has always been more than a mountain. it symbolized the emotional core of harlow, themes of childhood trauma, mental health, and social isolation. i spent four years filming across the pacific northwest coast, where i was born and raised. from oregon to alaska, these those landscapes influenced the way i built mount noraker particularly denali. i wanted it to feel inhospitable and untamed, like denali itself felt when i stood at the base of the mountain. noraker's base stretches roughly 3,000 blocks north-south and east-west, and it anchors the northern alyeska mountains, a desolate region on the far northwestern edge of jesla country in my world sky pixel. nearby peaks within this glacial basin include mount dełá ts’ina and mount sok’aan. the ísjarn dal ice fall, a massive valley ice fall, drops to nearly -500b below sea level, with surrounding mountains reaching 512b. to bring noraker to life, i pushed bedrock to its absolute limits — sculpting jagged cliffs, carved glacial basins, and rough alpine ridges with worldpainter and doing fine detailing in-game. i use high-end shaders such as bsl, complementary, and volumetric fog to enhance the depth, atmosphere, and lighting. i also have some design landscapes from worldpainter outlining areas with several labeled glaciers (tł'oh, nakaih, kk'one) leading down toward the koyukon basin. some of these terms were used by the athabaskan people of alaska, some images show locations / and peaks/ridges (red x's). as well as glacial drainage valleys (blue lines) for ultra–high-fidelity renders, i work in professional 3d software where i can implement displacement mapping and subdivision surface modeling — techniques that add micro-detail and realistic surface texture beyond what the game engine can handle, i also use these programs for the hyper-realistic lighting and dramatic skies. these programs include blender, cinema 4d, and also i use chunky, and mineways to, depending on the shot. noraker is inspired off of denali/foraker. not a replica. i took this approach because i wanted to keep my minecraft world sky pixel unique. what are your thoughts?", "raw_text": "A Major Mountain I designed in Minecraft Inspired by Denali", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T07:44:22+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 45, "num_comments": 10}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "gaming", "query": "", "submission_id": "1ovv53g"}}

{"id": "1ovxjur", "text": "trying to find my \"thing\" as a musician/music-lover okay so over the years (in my 30s now) i've learned to play some instruments (mainly guitar) and gotten lots of beginner gear (a few guitars, a bass, a keyboard, drumpad, misc recording stuff) and i've been learning some theory as well. and i've realized that the main reason i enjoy being a \"musician\" (in the sense of playing instruments, knowing some theory) is because it allows me to better appreciate the music i listen to, not because of anything to do with music-*making*. i absolutely love love love listening to music, paying attention to all the instruments and how everything fit together, and discovering new artists to listen to. i occasionally make some stuff, mostly from just playing around on my instruments. it's cool and fun to make stuff, but it just doesn't fulfill me the same way. music-making is mostly just a playground for me: a creative outlet, yes, but only to the degree of like how i used to build random things with lego when i was a kid. and i guess, going off the lego analogy, building stuff scratches a creative itch for me and it's nice to do here and there. but what really makes my heart sing is seeing other people's creations in all their glory, being moved viscerally by it, examining it with a critical and appreciative eye, and even taking it apart to see how it all fits together in the nerdiest way. i do sometimes wish i could get good enough to create amazing music like my favorite artists. but it's really just a wish, cuz honestly, i'd rather just listen to their art all day, instead of spending hours working on my own thing that would never hit the same. and also (perhaps more importantly?) because i have very little desire in me to self express in this way. anyway, i know whatever i described is totally valid and whatever. but i also want to take things further, to step up my game, to do something more. and if music-listening is my \"true love\" (or, you could say \"other people's music\" is my true love), then what can i do besides more listening?? i've done some covers here and there (used to be \"my thing\") but again, the desire doesn't really last, and again, at the end of the day, i'd rather just listen to the original. what are things i could do to level up or do more with my love for other people's music? perhaps do something to showcase or pay tribute to them? curious to hear your ideas or advice etc.", "raw_text": "Trying to find my \"thing\" as a musician/music-lover", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T10:21:07+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "Music", "query": "", "submission_id": "1ovxjur"}}

{"id": "1ovyqxx", "text": "ball x pit might be my favourite indie game of the year so i ended up sinking 27 hours into this game this past week after thinking to just give it a quick try on game pass. so, ball x pit is basically a type of rogue-like / rogue-lite and combination of old-school brick breaker games like arkanoid, vampire survivors, peggle and a few other new and nifty ideas. the gameplay itself is solid, having you fire balls up at enemies as you move through levels, but it’s everything that supports the gameplay that makes it so special. like vampire survivors, you collect gems to level up and then pick from upgrades to create unique builds that help you reach the end of a level and its three bosses. what really surprised me, though, was how much some of the unlockable characters, upgrades and systems change up the gameplay, and how each new level comes with its own challenges that suit different characters and playstyles. and yet, to add even more to the magic formula, ball x pit has great, addictive pacing thanks to a surprisingly fun town-building element. what i really liked is that between rounds, you manage a little town area where you use your money and materials to build and upgrade structures that provide boosts, harvest materials or unlock new characters, because it really keeps progression interesting. keeping with the theme of the game, you even send your characters out to harvest or build by strategically bouncing them around your town. the loop of playing a level, sorting out your town, collecting your resources and jumping back in for another run is exactly what makes this game so dangerously addictive. it’s perfect for 10-minute sessions but somehow manages to hook you for hours, especially with how much the gameplay and management systems keep expanding over time. i had a few bugs in the town/building parts of the game where the interfact would stop working and i had to restart the game, but the most recent patch fixed it so i've had no issues since. honestly, i like ball x pit more than i ever liked vampire survivors (although both are awesome). the gameplay is classic fun mixed with clever new concepts, and you’re not just at the mercy of random upgrades. i’ve loved playing ball x pit on xbox, but it would be absolutely perfect on a handheld (i wish it had cross-saves). if you’re looking for something new and ridiculously fun, i highly recommend you check it out.

{"id": "1ovykbq", "text": "opinion: sony is wise to release their latest live-service games only on mobile/pc, not ps5 yesterday, playstation announced two new live-service projects with third-party partners: **ratchet & clank: ranger rumble** (developed by oh bibi for mobile) and **horizon: steel frontiers** (developed by ncsoft for mobile and pc through the purple emulator). naturally, this has sparked discussions about why neither game is coming to ps5, with some claiming it signals that sony is “moving away from consoles.” personally, i think it’s actually *smart* that they’re not launching these on ps5, at least not right now. here’s why. over the past few years, playstation has gained a reputation (largely from its *own* fans) that it’s “chasing trends” with live-service games and “ruining” beloved ips to do so. every time a live-service title gets announced, sections of the playstation community immediately turn on it, calling it “live-service slop,” hoping it fails, and demanding sony “go back to its roots.” we saw this with *marathon*, where fans complained it wasn’t single-player and gatekept it before it even launched. this hostility has become a real brand problem for playstation leadership. they essentially have two choices: 1. stop making live-service games altogether (which makes no business sense given that roughly 40% of gamers *only* play such games), or 2. continue developing them, but release them *away* from the playstation ecosystem where the loudest resistance comes from. that’s why i think these new games are launching on mobile and pc instead of ps5. of course, this shift has already created a *new* narrative: that sony is “abandoning” its platform and core audience. but honestly, this is a *better* problem to have. by keeping these games off ps5 initially, sony flips the psychology; instead of fans wanting them to fail, they’ll now start asking for ps5 ports. and when those ports inevitably happen, fans will be *grateful* to get them instead of resentful. there are also practical reasons: * these games are made by third-party partners, not playstation studios. * they’re clearly not on the same visual or technical level as *rift apart* or *forbidden west*, and releasing them on ps5 could hurt the perceived quality of those ips. * being heavily microtransaction-driven, they don’t really fit with playstation 5’s “premium” image. * and finally, both ips have *mainline* ps5 entries in development (*insomniac* is working on another ratchet, and *guerrilla* reportedly has a monster hunter-style horizon game coming). oversaturating the ps5 with side projects could lead to fatigue. so overall, i think sony made the right call. limiting these two games to mobile (and pc) keeps their console ecosystem clean, avoids backlash from their most vocal fans, and allows them to reintroduce these games later (on *their own* terms) if the demand is there.", "raw_text": "Opinion: Sony is wise to release their latest live-service games only on Mobile/PC, not PS5", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T11:22:38+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 0, "num_comments": 11}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "gaming", "query": "", "submission_id": "1ovykbq"}}

{"id": "1ouj47e", "text": "searching for life's purpose (if the post is too long, just answer these questions: what do you think the purpose of life is, and do you have any advice for me? do we even have free will?) i am 23 year old a recent computer science graduate, and i am really unsure what to do in life. first of all, i am truly confused: what is the purpose of our life? is it doing great things? is it solving big problems for society that fundamentally change and help future generations? or is making ourselves happy the priority? initially, i thought the purpose of life was making money, making your parents proud, and buying whatever you want. inspired by tech founders like elon musk and mark zuckerberg, i worked incredibly hard. i used to work all day, had zero social life, no connection with family and friends, and tried to prove to the world what i was capable of so that no one would ever take me lightly. in the end, i became depressed. i don't hate what i did, but i felt like i was working hard without seeing it as part of a whole life. someone once said: dreams are just to dream; don't live in them. then, i started thinking differently. i changed my mind: nothing is more important than your physical and mental health. so, i decided to take it easy. i began to realize that nothing else truly mattered to me—neither how others saw me nor what others possessed. i was happy with little money. i then realized that life is just a matter of perspective. someone with a luxurious life may feel sad, while someone with almost nothing can be happier than them because he or she doesn't expect anything from life. it's like pain is there, but nobody suffers because it depends on the perspective: how you see something, what you expect, how your mind releases dopamine, and how you perceive your surroundings to be satisfied with your life. so, i concluded the purpose of life is to be happy. i considered living in a small village, perhaps in a good area, and becoming a local school teacher to live a simple and peaceful life (which i once thought was the way to a happy life). and yet... i then realized we only live once, and since i don't know what happens after death, i should avoid doing ordinary things like wasting time on social media or watching movies and series to live a fantasy life we can't afford. instead, i thought i should build something truly great in life that nobody has thought of before, like einstein in science, pablo picasso in art, or elon musk in business. (i really don't want to *be* any of them, but i admire them because i think one should be unique.) it's most shocking to realize that most people live life for others—driven by how people judge them, inspired by social media influencers, or just trying to fit into society, which is a common human desire. some people even live in illogical mental states, like following religious gurus and being illogical their whole life, yet they are truly happy because they believe whatever happens is for the good. most shockingly, many people never question the illogical aspects of their minds, living out fantasies, exhibiting personality traits they don't want, or living a life driven by stubbornness or an illogical mindset. they live just to show off, seeking external validation for how others see and perceive them. i genuinely love sciences. in school, physics and math were my favorite subjects. i wanted to go into a hardware-related field but landed in computer science, which i truly enjoyed learning. i also love reading and solving complex and hard problems. i tend to go too deep and critical into any problem, be it psychology, religion, business, philosophy, or life itself. sometimes, i feel like i am either overthinking or i am a perfectionist. i feel that whatever i do, i must do it fully, with passion and love, and truly enjoy it. i love history, space science,math, and exploring **nature** like an **explorer**, whether it's the sea, the jungle, or animals, among so many different fields. i am really unsure about my future: should i build a tech startup (failure or success doesn't matter, but just try it), or go for a master's in space science or robotics? then sometimes, i feel like there are so many things in life, and you can never do all of them. perhaps i should just go into a field where i have an edge due to my past 23 years, utilizing my love for math, physics, history, psychology, and business. but i want to start from zero if needed. i don't want to live someone else's life or be trapped in an illogical mindset, but most importantly, in today's capitalism, money matters the most. what really matters at the end of life? happiness, health, or connections? what is it? so, i have followings questions: what do you think the purpose of life is? do you have any advice for me? do we even have free will?", "raw_text": "Searching for Life's Purpose (If the post is too long, just answer these questions: What do you think the purpose of life is, and do you have any advice for me?

{"id": "1ow3t6v", "text": "impacts of government shutdowns & lack of data government shutdowns cost the economy money. while we could discuss the inefficiencies of government, i am sure we all can agree that when anything is shutdown, it is not efficient. while no historical analogy is perfect because the conditions are always different, here is a report of the estimated impact the shutdown in q4 2013 had: source: [impacts and costs of the october 2013 federal government shutdown]( here are some excerpts from the tl;dr report from independent experts: leading independent forecasters estimate that the shutdown will lower fourth quarter real gdp growth by 0.2-0.6 percentage points or more, or $2-$6 billion in lost output. * **standard and poor’s:** “we believe that, to date, the shutdown has shaved at least 0.6% off of annualized fourth-quarter 2013 gdp growth…” * **macroeconomic advisers:** “calibrating \\[the 1995-1996 shutdowns\\] to today’s economy, we estimate that a two-week shutdown would directly trim about 0.3 percentage point from fourth quarter growth, mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees.” * **goldman sachs** projected that the shutdown would reduce gdp growth by 0.14 percentage points per week, even after most furloughed department of defense employees returned to work. * **mark zandi, moody’s:** “the 16-day federal shutdown and political brinksmanship around the treasury debt ceiling hurt the economy. the hit to fourth quarter real gdp is estimated at… half a percentage point of growth.” the 2013 shutdown lasted only 16-days. the one we just had was more than double. while it is basically pumpkin math and overly-simplified, based on time alone, if the impacts are double then real gdp growth could take a hit somewhere in the range of 0.4-1.2 percentage points. and also keep in mind, this figure can only be \"forecast\" and not measured directly (nobody knows what would have actually happened without the shutdown). one thing to consider is that this current administration is changing a lot of things up and doing so very quickly and inconsistently. as a result, all of the entities that need to interface with the government are left with lots of questions and uncertainty (e.g., permitting). this administration also seems to make one-off allowances and applies a personal touch on a case-by-case basis (e.g., tariffs for certain countries, allowances for certain companies, etc.). without getting political, with all of the uncertainty and haphazard implementation, this isn't a good time for the government to be shutdown and could potentially exacerbate the impacts of the extended closure. we have all heard grumblings from the likes of powell about the poor quality and lack of data coming in. and even when the people collecting the data are working, some are being fired. seeing how drastic the revisions have been on the employment reports, i have little confidence on any initial report coming out of the government. now, we are being told there may be no reports at all: source: [white house says key economic reports may not be released]( less data and more rhetoric seems to align with the desired goals of this administration that also wants to do away with quarterly earnings reports. i am not sure if cancelling the release of these reports is a flaw or a desired feature. point being, keeping people in the dark is never a good thing. and the market hates negative surprises. when (and if) reports start coming out again, we are all still going to have to wait until the revised versions come out even later to get a clear picture. to end, the markets didn't seem to care at all in 2013 or 2014 about the shutdown and lower gdp. looking at the s&p 500, it ticked right on up through both years with a 32.39% total return in 2013 and a 13.69% in 2014. however, the s&p 500 shiller pe ratio was roughly half of what it is now (40.4 today vs. \\~21.9 in 2013). this current bull market has been wild and nobody can say when it will end. everything has been shrugged off and every tiny dip bought up immediately. all this might be no different. and by the time the gdp is reported, it might be delayed and so far in the rearview mirror that it won't matter to the markets if gdp growth is zero for q4. however, i am worried that things are priced to optimistically right now and trimmed my holdings this week. that might prove to be a mistake but only time will tell.", "raw_text": "Impacts of Government Shutdowns & Lack of Data", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T15:19:45+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1ow3t6v"}}

{"id": "1ow4ims", "text": "just rewatched \"(500) days of summer\" and it's honestly a masterclass in modern relationship dynamics i just finished watching this movie again and wow, it hit differently this time. i think this film is genuinely one of the best representations of how relationships actually work (or don't work) in real life, and it's aged incredibly well. **tl;dr for those who haven't seen it:** the movie follows tom, a hopeless romantic who falls hard for summer, a woman who doesn't believe in love or relationships. it's told non-linearly across 500 days, showing the highs and lows of their relationship. the twist? summer was upfront from day one that she didn't want anything serious, but tom kept hoping she'd change her mind. the film brilliantly deconstructs the \"manic pixie dream girl\" trope and shows how we often project our fantasies onto people rather than seeing them for who they really are. **why i think it's so relevant:** the movie doesn't pick sides—it shows tom's genuine feelings while also highlighting how he ignored every sign that they wanted different things. summer wasn't the villain for being honest about what she wanted, and tom wasn't wrong for catching feelings. they were just incompatible, and that's okay. it also does an amazing job showing how we romanticize relationships in hindsight, literally showing the \"expectations vs. reality\" split screen that lives rent-free in my head. **questions for discussion:** - do you think the movie is fair to both characters, or does it lean toward one perspective? - how do you interpret the ending? optimistic or just tom repeating the same pattern? - does summer get too much hate from viewers, or is the criticism valid? - what scene hit you the hardest? would love to hear your takes, especially if you've watched it recently or multiple times and noticed your perspective shifting!", "raw_text": "Just rewatched \"(500) Days of Summer\" and it's honestly a masterclass in modern relationship dynamics", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T15:47:38+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 1, "num_comments": 0}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "movies", "query": "", "submission_id": "1ow4ims"}}

[abcnews.go.com]( is real. abc money is fake. businessmole isn't bloomberg. similar name, different site. gardening blogs don't break billion dollar m&a news. identical wording across sources means copy/paste, not real reporting. no confirmation from reuters, bloomberg, or wsj. if it's real, they report it. timing was too convenient. apollo withdrew 6 days earlier. new offer appears right when retail is desperate. this isn't some penny stock scam. this is papa johns - nasdaq listed, $1.4 billion market cap. if scammers can manipulate a stock this size with fake news, they can do it to anything. and they are. hunterbrook mentioned this has happened to at least 3 other stocks recently using the same fake news network. how to protect yourself: verify the source. is this a real news outlet? does the url match? wait for confirmation. real m&a deals get announced via sec 8-k filings and company press releases. check multiple legitimate sources. if reuters, bloomberg, and wsj aren't reporting it, it's probably fake. look for specific details. real m&a announcements include deal terms, financing, board approval status. fake news is vague with \"sources say\" and \"approximately.\" the lesson here: when a real m&a deal falls through, scammers see opportunity. they know retail is holding bags and desperate. that's when fake news pumps happen. papa johns went from legitimate m&a target to pump and dump victim in 6 days. retail who bought the fake news yesterday are down today. the scammers made money. this is why you verify everything. this is why fake news in the stock market isn't just annoying, it's theft. stay sharp. source: [", "raw_text": "Papa Johns Just Got Hit With a Coordinated Fake News Pump - Here's How It Worked", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T18:40:09+00:00", "platform": "reddit", "engagement": {"score": 8, "num_comments": 1}, "lang": "en", "meta": {"subreddit": "stocks", "query": "", "submission_id": "1ow95um"}}
